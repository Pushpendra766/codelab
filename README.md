# Codelab

Codelab is an online coding tool that can be used for writing, testing, experimenting, and sharing HTML, CSS, and Javascript code fragments. It also shows the output and behavior of the code on the output screen.

The most important feature of Codelab is AI Integration in it, which provides the capability to generate HTML, CSS, and Javascript code of the desired components instantly at the click of a button.
